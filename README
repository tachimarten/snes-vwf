This is a small variable-width font engine for the SNES/65816 CPU. It also contains a patch to
Final Fantasy 6 to use it for long enemy names, which allows the SNES version to use the longer
GBA names for enemies.

Note that, currently, Gau's Rage list uses the original, shorter enemy names.

To build the demo, just say:

    $ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cc65/bin make

To patch FF6, place an *expanded* copy of the US ROM in the directory named `ff6.smc` and run:

    $ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cc65/bin make ff6

The resulting ROM will be written to `ff6vwf.smc`.

You need to expand the original ROM to 32MBit first with Lunar Expand or similar. The makefile
doesn't yet do this for you.
