This is a small variable-width font engine for the SNES/65816 CPU. It also contains a patch to
Final Fantasy 6 to use it for long enemy names, which allows the SNES version to use the longer
GBA names for enemies.

Note that, currently, Gau's Rage list uses the original, shorter enemy names.

To build the demo, just say:

    $ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cc65/bin make

To patch FF6, place an original copy of the US v1.0 ROM in the source directory named `ff6.smc` and
run:

    $ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cc65/bin make ff6

The resulting ROM will be written to `ff6vwf.smc`.
